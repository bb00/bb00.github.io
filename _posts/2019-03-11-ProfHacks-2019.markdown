This last weekend, I attended ProfHacks 2019. It was an interesting experience, being my first hackathon since high school.

I came alone, with my 3 laptops in tow, all provided by my workplace for one purpose or another:

* My daily driver, a 13" Retina Early 2015 MacBook Pro with 2-core 3.1GHz i7 and Iris 6100 graphics iGPU,
* my Windows box, a Surface Pro 4,
* my pentest machine, an EliteBook 840 G3 upgraded for a total 8GB memory,
